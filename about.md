The [National Guideline Clearinghouse](http://www.guideline.gov) was a database of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines managed by the [Agency for Healthcare Research Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov), which in turn is an agency of the United States [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov).

Unfortunately, it was taken offline as of July 18, 2018, due to a lack of federal funding.  But this information was archived by a GitHub user named [roguengc](https://github.com/roguengc).  So I spent a few days putting together this website with these goals in mind:

- Preserve all summaries taken offline by the Trump administration in an easily-readable form.
- Do not compromise the content or the structure of each document.
- Make it easy for an organization with more time and money than me to incorporate the archived data in their own sites.
- Provide a simple, no-frills website that is usable as a reference in its own right.

The site you're reading now is primarily for users of the underlying information (i.e. doctors, nurses, etc.).  If you want the raw data (in either XML or the Markdown I generated), grab it [here](https://github.com/JesseTG/ngc_dump).
