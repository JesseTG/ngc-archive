There are a few things I need to make really, *really* clear.

- I am not (and have never been) affiliated with any local, state, or federal government (or institution thereof) within the United States.  The same is true of this website.
- I did not write any of the information archived on this site.
- I did not scrape the data from the NGC.  [This person did](https://github.com/roguengc), but that's not me.  Whoever you are, thank you and great job.
- I am not a doctor.  Don't ask me for medical advice, and don't ask me about the information archived here.  I don't know what any of it means.
- The search page has ads, unfortunately.  Google only allows you to disable them if you're working on behalf of a school, a non-profit, or a government agency.  I have no interest in monetizing this site.  If you're part of a non-profit and would like to adopt this site, please get in touch with me.
- I will not be adding information to this site that wasn't already on the NGC.
